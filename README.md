# Bitfarm

This repository contains the code for an Agricultural Supply Chain Dapp With Micro-Finance functionality, coded using *Truffle* and *Solidity*. The backend blockchain is a private Ethereum network setup using **Geth(go-ethereum)* and the interactions are made possible by *Web3* javascript library.
Used Matic side chain to increase the transaction speed.
## What problems are we solving?

An Agricultural Supply Chain tracks a farm product from the farmer to the consumer. Farmers in developing countries are heavily dependent on bank loans. Due to this heavy debt , farmers can't maintain a steady production of agriculture. Micro-finance can help these farmers out of debt.


## Our solution to the problem:

*Bitfarm* is a distributed market place for farmers to trade there produce directly with consumers. The consumer can check out the quality of produce based on previous year's sale record. Ensuring a transparent common place where farmers and consumer entract directly eliminating middle man in the process. To make the system loan proof we did implimented micro-finance in our digital market place. By this implimentation consumers can invest money in farmer's land, making concept of loan for farming obsolete as farmers can use investment for farming giving share of profit to consumers in produce or case as they wish. 


Eventually, the Bitfarm will build a decentralized farm-market where the farmers can easily raise fund for cultivation along with the customers in his hand for buying his produce. On the other hand the customers can ensure quality products at lesser price with an early investment on the crops. Both the customers and farmers could yield profit and build a loyal environment for future cooperation. The best farmer will get the maximum profit on the produce and the best investor (consumer) can ensure good quality food for his home.
