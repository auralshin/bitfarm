# Bitfarm

This repository contains the code for an Agricultural Supply Chain Dapp With Micro-Finance functionality, coded using *Truffle* and *Solidity*. The backend blockchain is a private Ethereum network setup using **Geth(go-ethereum)* and the interactions are made possible by *Web3* javascript library.
Used Matic side chain to increase the transaction speed.
## What problems are we solving?

An Agricultural Supply Chain tracks a farm product from the farmer to the consumer. Farmers in developing countries are heavily dependent on bank loans. Due to this heavy debt , farmers can't maintain a steady production of agriculture. Micro-finance can help these farmers out of debt.


## Our solution to the problem:

*Bitfarm*, is a  blockchain based transparent market place where the farmers and consumers could implement a co-operative farming method. Here, the farmers can list the potential crops and the expected yield on his farm on the distributed public ledger. The consumers can view the details and check for the farmer credibility based on the previous cultivation and supply. This creates a transparent and tamper-proof digital market platform for farm products. Thus an agreement (consensus) can be formed between farmer and consumer, such that the consumer can fund individual crops or a field and can acquire or the yield from the farm or the profit percentage of its market value. There will be a rating mechanism to build the credibility of farmer and consumer based on the previous experiences in the agromarket.

The important advantages are:

1.	The farmer does not have to wait for bank loan or other lending mechanisms to raise the initial investment. The consumers could provide the fund with zero interest.

2.	The consumers could get quality products at cheaper rates as they are funding the crops/fields right from the time of cultivation. 

3.	No need to have huge farmlands. Even the small scale farmers and household farmers can also sell their products and yield better profit.

4.	An efficient supply chain can be ensured with point to point update over the immutable chains. Customers could choose specific farmers for specific products.

5.	The farmers can build consumer loyalty based on the quality of product and type of farming, which could eventually yield him better profits.

6.	Even the low income group consumers can fund the crops based on their needs and can escape from the market fluctuations of the product prices.

7.	Organic farming and quality measurement can be assured with frequent quality checking by the concerned authorities. The immutable ledger ensures transparency and reduces the chances of fraud.

8.	Smart contracts can provide a better agreement between the farmers and consumers in case of discrepancies arising with regard to natural calamities, climate changes or other crop loss situations

Eventually, the Bitfarm will build a decentralized agro-market where the farmers can easily raise fund for cultivation along with the customers in his hand for buying his produce. On the other hand the customers can ensure quality products at lesser price with an early investment on the crops. Both the customers and farmers could yield profit and build a loyal environment for future cooperation. The best farmer will get the maximum profit on the produce and the best investor (consumer) can ensure good quality food for his home.
